# Standard-Embedded-Systems-Diploma

Course Achievements
•	Learned C programming and data structures algorithms including: variables, operators, conditional statements, loops, functions, arrays, pointer, data modifiers, preprocessor directives, and dynamic memory allocation and created +80 C files.
•	Identified Software Engineering Testing Fundamentals (Project Life Cycle, Software Development Plans, The Seven Testing Principles, Software Quality Characteristics, and Black and White Box Testing).
•	 Identified Embedded System Concepts (Types, Challenges, SB and SOC, MCU Parts (Processor, Memory, and other peripherals)).
•	Created various AVR ATMega32 MCU projects using Embedded C to deal with: DIO, ADC, Interrupts, Timers, USART, SPI, I2C, and EEPROM with +50 projects.
•	Interfaced different electronic components with MCU including: LEDs and Switches (DIP, Ductile, Optocoupler, Darlington Pair, Relay, NPN and PNP Transistors), 7 Segment, LCD, Keypad, Motors (DC, Stepper, Servo), LM35, LDR and created Drivers for DIO, ADC, LCD, and other components.
•	Identified RTOS concept and compared between it and GPOS.
•	Identified OS components (task, scheduler, and dispatcher) and their objectives, then created simplified C functions to prove their functionality.
•	Designed different projects with the use of static and dynamic design concept, then used my written OS functions to implement them.
•	Acquired the basic information about FreeRTOS.
•	Identified the compilation process (preprocessor, compiler, assembler, and linker).
•	Learned the basic information about: make file, start up code, linker script, and bootloader.
•	Identified basic information about automotive communication protocols including CAN and LIN.
•	Designed and implemented POV Clock as a graduation project for the diploma.
